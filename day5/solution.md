## Solution:

``` sh
> cat input.txt | sort | see
```

convert extrem line with calculator app on mac ^^

### Part 2:

* align first full row to a line number aligned with 10
* add newlines after each RRR ending so all rows are aligned.

* scroll and find missing line
* convert again using calculator on the mac

* alternatively just do a serach and replace to make the lines binary and use a convert tool of your choice (the id is just the decimal representation of the full binary)
